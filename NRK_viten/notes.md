General notes
--------------
Big Bang -> BBN -> H, He(,Li,Be)
First stars (population 3) -> 1<Z<26 Fusion
Nuclear problem (no more energy)
-> capture processes (mostly neutrons)
First stars die:
- m\_c < 1.4 M\_sol -> WD
- 1.4 M\_sol < m\_c < 2-3-ish M\_sol -> NS
- 2-3-ish M\_sol < m\_c -> BH
Corresponding initial masses:
- m\_0 < 8 M\_sol -> WD
- 8 M\_sol < m\_0 < 20-ish M\_sol -> NS
- 20-ish M\_sol < m\_0 -> BH
Supernova:
Start with dense shock wave eminating from center.
Long believed to be the only source of r-process level neutron densities.
Neutron star mergers suggested by Lattimer&Schramm 1977.

Stucture
---------
History from BBN -> Fe
S-process production in stars
What is missing? r-process
Supernova - some Au-production, but not much
Remnants - mostly neutrons
Binary systems and gravitational waves
Merging - neutrons banded flung out into cosmos as nuclides at great speeds.
Neutron-heavy nuclides are unstable -> beta-decay (n->p^+ + e^-)
beta-decay over several days leads to stable heavy isotopes, Lanthanides.
