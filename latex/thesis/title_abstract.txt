Modelling uncertainty of the Rhenium-Osmium cosmic clock

The nuclide 187Re beta-decays to 187Os with a half-life of approximately 41.6
Gyr. The long half-life and simple relation between
187Re and 187Os makes the
ratio a good candidate for a cosmic clock. In order to "use the clock" we must
determine the production of 187Re and 187Os through chemical enrichment of
the Galaxy. This is a complicated task with a large number of assumptions and
simplifications involved.
The uncertainties related to some of the uncertanties are investigated.
A hydrodynamical simulation is approximated with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model. The physical parameters of the chemical evolution model
is varied by generating random numbers with a gaussian distribution to emulate
the uncertainty of parameters.
I conclude that observational constraints on r-process nuclei does not affect
the cosmochronology of the Re-Os system much. The Galactic history, like star
formation and mass function over time, would have greater effect on the cosmochronology.
