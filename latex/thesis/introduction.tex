\section{Introduction}

After the big bang and the elements formed, the chart of nuclides was scarcsly filled.
Only the lightest elements and isotopes, hydrogen and helium primarily, filled the vast universe\cite{alphabetagamma}, in addition to the dark matter.
In the universe today we see much more heavier elements, and these must have been synthesised in some manner.
Nuclear fusion in stars create heavier elements up to iron, the heavier elements are made as by-products in which heavy atoms accumulates neutrons or protons and climb the chart of nuclides.\cite{BBFH}
