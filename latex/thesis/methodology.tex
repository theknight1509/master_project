\section{Methodology}

In this thesis the goal is to examine the influence of uncertainty in models and parameters
with regards to r-process nucleosynthesis. This will be done by comparing simple galactic chemical evolution models to high resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations.

The chemical evolution used is \omegamodel, due to it's simplicity and versatility in executing. \omegamodel\ also demonstrates a much larger resolution in mass, resolving the mass into many different isotopes.
The smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation \eris is a highresoltuion simulation that resembles the Milky Way Galaxy in many aspects, and is therefor a great candidate for a Milky Way Proxy. Assuming that the evolution of \eris also resembles the evolution of the Milky Way allows us to use the star formation history and baryonic content data from \eris in order to match the generated data from \omegamodel.
