\chapter{Numerical background}
\label{sec:numerical-background}

As mentioned in the introduction, this work will focus on comparing semianalytical models of chemical evolution with large-scale hydrodynamical simulations.
This chapter will present the framework used for semianalytical modelling and the simulation to compare it to.
Hydrodynamical simulations are more realistic and have a higher spatial resolution. They are however more compuatioanlly expensive compared to semianalytical models.
