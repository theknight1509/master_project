Best fit of 'Omega' parameters
=====================================

This directory contains the structural progress of finding the parameter-space that best reproduces the 'Eris' results, with r-process postproduction by Shen (Apr. 2015).

Folder contents
-----------------

- ['omega-new'](omega_new.py) inherits all aspects of the 'Omega'-model, but feed all the parameters from a single namespace(passed as argument to initializer).
- ['bestfit-file'](bestfit_file.py) contains the default parameters in a namespace that can be used by 'omega-new'
- ['bestfit-file-current'](current_bestfit.py) contains the parameter-space that best reproduces 'Eris', as documented by the find-bestfit-folders'
- ['find-bestfit-folder-v0'](find_bestfit_param_v0) tracks the progress of 'Omega' after forcibly introducing direct results from 'Eris'.
- ['find-bestfit-folder-v1'](find_bestfit_param_v1) tracks the progress of 'Omega' as the total mass and flow is added to match results from 'Eris' as best as possible.
- ['find-bestfit-folder-v2'](find_bestfit_param_v2) tracks the progress of 'Omega' while the type 1a supernovae are tweaked to match 'Eris' as best as possible.
- ['find-bestfit-folder-v3'](find_bestfit_param_v3) tracks the progress of 'Omega' while the binary neutron star mergers are tweaked to match 'Eris' as best as possible.
