    The \textit{Ant Nebula} shows the outbound ejecta from a central object.
    The white dwarf in the center, as well as the low iron-to-nickel ratio in the nebula is consistent with an asymptotic giant branch star.
    The higher iron-to-nickel ratio closer to the center suggests the presence of a massive star as well as a white dwarf\mycite{Zhang06}.
