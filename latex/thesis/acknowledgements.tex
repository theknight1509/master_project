\section*{Acknowledgements}

Many thanks to Signe Riemer-S{\o}rensen for giving me the opportunity to work on this project and being a great mentor and advisor. I could not have doen this without your continous support and guidance.

I would like to thank all the students in the Stellar Cellar and student council to keep me sane this past year, and constantly remind me I am not.

The list of people that have helped and supported me would be too long to fit in this thesis, but a special thanks to all of you!
You know who you are.
