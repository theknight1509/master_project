\section{Uncertainty of parameters}

\subsection{Method}
For varying different parameters simultaneously a similar method was used as in section \ref{sec:results-yields}, where a ``fudge-factor'' was applied to the \eris\ best fitted parameter-values. The ``fudge-factor'' is distributed gaussian around 1.0 and the factor is the multiplied to the parameter-value.

%% The parameter values chosen are the ones that deal with r-process production; fraction of neutron stars that merge (number of mergers), the ejecta mass from a single neutron star merger, the delay-time distribution of merging events.
%% Also the relevant r-process isotopes \re{187}, \re{185}, \w{184}, \os{188}, and the relevant s-process isotopes \os{187}, \os{186}.
%% These are chosen because they lie close to the \re{187}-\os{187} pair in the chart of nuclides and also closely related to the s-process path (and branching path).

%description of the different experiments
\newcommand\expone{\textbf{Yields}}
\newcommand\exptwo{\textbf{Yields+IMFslope}}
There are two main experiments;
\begin{description}
\item[\expone] The yields of isotopes are varied within their standard deviation \comment{Add reference to arnould table}
\item[\exptwo] The yields of isotopes are varied \textit{and} the high mass slope of the initial mass function, $\alpha$, is varied within the uncertainty found in \mycite{cote16a}, which is $\sigma_{\alpha}=8.73\%$ around the mean $\langle \alpha \rangle = 2.29$.
\end{description}

%present data
The solar system is formed from a collapse of interstellar gas. The gas is assumed to have separated from the interstellar medium at the formation of the solar system.
The formation of the solar system is estimated from meteorites to be 4.5 Gyrs ago \comment{add citation and expand on meteorite articles}
From the semianalytical model, \omegamodel, the total mass of \os{187} and \re{187} in the interstellar medium is calculated.
The fraction between the two isotopes, $f_{187} = \frac{\os{187}}{\re{187}}$, is also calculated.
The fraction between the isotopes is relevant because it can be determined from meteorites, unlike the total mass of isotopes in the \sos\ at the time of formation.
In the \eris-simulation the galactic age is 14 Gyrs, which means the solar system formed at 9.5 Gyrs.
The uncertainties of the mass of each isotope come from the uncertainty of the input parameters in each experiment, \expone\ and \exptwo.

Nucleosynthesis/production from stellar sources is considered as well as the radioactive decay from \re{187} to \os{187}. The amount of type II supernovae are also varied because the high mass slope of the initial mass function gives more massive stars, which in turn give more type II supernovae.
