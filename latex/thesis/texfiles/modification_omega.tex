%write description and code to single-yield modification

In order to manipulate the program \omegamodel\ without changing the source code, which can be found on \comment{website to omega}, inheritance of python-classes was used.

By creating a new python-class that inherits all methods from \omegamodel\ (which inherits many methods from \chemevol ), and making a new function with the same name as the function that sets the yield tables, the old funciton is overridden by the new.
The old function in \chemevol\ is called \verb|__set_yield_tables|, and the new function, \verb|chem_evol__set_yield_tables|, has all the same content and overrides the old function. By adding a few lines of code to the end of the yield-table function, a 'fudge factor' is multiplied to the yield of a single isotope across all yield-tables used.
The extra lines of code are shown below.
